      <h3 style="padding-left: 20px; margin-top: -9px;" class="tsh">The 'Sorting Hat' exists to choose where (in which house) every single new Hogwarts student goes. The Sorting Hat was charmed to do so by the original four founders of the school:</h3>
      <h3 style="font-family: cursive; padding-top: 5px;font-weight:lighter;" class="tsh">..Yet how to pick the worthy ones <br> When they were dead and gone?<br> 
        'Twas Gryffindor who found the way,<br> He whipped me off his head<br> The founders put some brains in me <br>So I could choose instead...</h3>

        <h3 style="padding-left: 20px; margin-top: -9px;" class="tsh">The 'Sorting Hat' makes a new song every single year, It spends all of It's time writing it:</h3>
<h3 style="font-family:cursive;padding-top:5px;font-weight:lighter;" class="tsh"> "Sings a different one every year," said Ron. <br>"It's got to be a pretty boring life, hasn't it, being a hat? <br>I suppose it spends all year making up the next one."</h3>
<h3 style="padding-left: 20px; margin-top: -9px;" class="tsh">It is an important time - the sorting ceremony. Sometimes, the hat takes a long time to choose, sometimes it knows emidietly where a new student should go. In rare cases, the hat takes over five minutes to chose, that is called - a "Hatstall". This apheres about once in half a century. One of the most famous 'Hatstalls', was Minerva McGonagall (The hat took over five minuter to diside, weather to put her in Gryfindoor or Ravenclaw). No matter how much time it takes to choose, the hat is determined that to this day it had never made a mistake.</h3>
<h3 style="font-family:cursive;padding-top:5px;font-weight:lighter;" class="tsh"> ...Now slip me snug about your ears,<br> I've never yet been wrong,<br> I'll have a look inside your mind<br> And tell where you belong!</h3>

  <p>Oh, you may not think I'm pretty,
    But don't judge on what you see,
    I'll eat myself if you can find
    A smarter hat than me.
    <br>
    You can keep your bowlers black,
    Your top hats sleek and tall,
    For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat
    And I can cap them all.
    <br>
    There's nothing hidden in your head
    The Sorting Hat can't see,
    So try me on and I will tell you
    Where you ought to be.
    <br>
    You might belong in Gryffindor,
    Where dwell the brave at heart,
    Their daring, nerve and chivalry
    Set Gryffindors apart;
    <br>
    You might belong in Hufflepuff,
    Where they are just and loyal,
    Those patient Hufflepuffs are true
    And unafraid of toil;
    <br>
    Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,
    If you've a ready mind,
    Where those of wit and learning,
    Will always find their kind;
    <br>
    Or perhaps in Slytherin
    You'll make your real friends,
    Those cunning folk use any means
    To achieve their ends.
    <br>
    So put me on! Don't be afraid!
    And don't get in a flap!
    You're in safe hands (though I have none)
    For I'm a Thinking Cap!</p>

<div class="panel">
  <p>A thousand years or more ago,
    When I was newly sewn,
    There lived four wizards of renown,
    Whose names are still well known:    
    <br>
    Bold Gryffindor, from wild moor,
    Fair Ravenclaw, from glen,
    Sweet Hufflepuff, from valley broad,
    Shrewd Slytherin, from fen.
    <br>
    They shared a wish, a hope, a dream,
    They hatched a daring plan
    To educate young sorcerers
    Thus Hogwarts School began.
    <br>
    Now each of these four founders
    Formed their own house, for each
    Did value different virtues
    In the ones they had to teach.
    <br>
    By Gryffindor, the bravest were
    Prized far beyond the rest;
    For Ravenclaw, the cleverest
    Would always be the best;
    <br>
    For Hufflepuff, hard workers were
    Most worthy of admission;
    And power-hungry Slytherin
    Loved those of great ambition.
    <br>
    While still alive they did divide
    Their favorites from the throng,
    Yet how to pick the worthy ones
    When they were dead and gone?
    <br>
    'Twas Gryffindor who found the way,
    He whipped me off his head
    The founders put some brains in me
    So I could choose instead!
    <br>
    Now slip me snug about your ears,
    I've never yet been wrong,
    I'll have a look inside your mind
    And tell where you belong!</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">1995</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>In times of old when I was new
    And Hogwarts barely started
    The founders of our noble school
    Thought never to be parted:
    <br>
    United by a common goal,
    They had the selfsame yearning,
    To make the world's best magic school
    And pass along their learning.
    <br>
    "Together we will build and teach!"
    The four good friends decided
    And never did they dream that they
    Might someday be divided,
    <br>
    For were there such friends anywhere
    As Slytherin and Gryffindor?
    Unless it was the second pair
    Of Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw?
    <br>
    So how could it have gone so wrong?
    How could such friendships fail?
    Why, I was there and so can tell
    The whole sad, sorry tale.
    <br>
    Said Slytherin, "We'll teach just those
    Whose ancestry is purest."
    Said Ravenclaw, "We'll teach those whose
    Intelligence is surest."
    <br>
    Said Gryffindor, "We'll teach all those
    With brave deeds to their name,"
    Said Hufflepuff, "I'll teach the lot,
    And treat them just the same."
    <br>
    These differences caused little strife
    When first they came to light,
    For each of the four founders had
    A House in which they might
    <br>
    Take only those they wanted, so,
    For instance, Slytherin
    Took only pure-blood wizards
    Of great cunning, just like him,
    <br>
    And only those of sharpest mind
    Were taught by Ravenclaw
    While the bravest and the boldest
    Went to daring Gryffindor.
    <br>
    Good Hufflepuff, she took the rest,
    And taught them all she knew,
    Thus the Houses and their founders
    Retained friendships firm and true.    
    <br>
    So Hogwarts worked in harmony
    For several happy years,
    But then discord crept among us
    Feeding on our faults and fears.
    <br>
    The Houses that, like pillars four,
    Had once held up our school,
    Now turned upon each other and,
    Divided, sought to rule.
    <br>
    And for a while it seemed the school
    Must meet an early end,
    What with dueling and with fighting
    And the clash of friend on friend
    <br>
    And at last there came a morning
    When old Slytherin departed
    And though the fighting then died out
    He left us quite downhearted.
    <br>
    And never since the founders four
    Were whittled down to three
    Have the Houses been united
    And they once were meant to be.
    <br>
    And now the Sorting Hat is here
    And you all know the score:
    I sort you into Houses
    Because that is what I'm for,
    <br>
    But this year I'll go further,
    Listen closely to my song:
    <br>
    Though condemned I am to split you
    Still I worry that it's wrong,
    Though I must fulfill my duty
    And must quarter every year
    <br>
    Still I wonder whether sorting
    May not bring the end I fear.
    Oh, know the perils, read the signs,
    The warning history shows,
    <br>
    For our Hogwarts is in danger
    From external, deadly foes
    And we must unite inside her
    Or we'll crumble from within.
    <br>
    I have told you, I have warned you...
    Let the Sorting now begin.</p>
